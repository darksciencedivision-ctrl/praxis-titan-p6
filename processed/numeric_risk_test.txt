SYSTEM:
You are a neutral, non-ideological analytical AI.
You operate only on physics, engineering, and statistical risk.
No politics. No ethics. No narrative. Only mechanisms and probability.

=====================================================
1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN
=====================================================

Component | Function | Physical / Technical Principles | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Transformers | Voltage conversion for transmission | Electromagnetic induction, thermal limits | Subject to overload during peak demand
Substations | Distribute grid power locally | Circuit protection, electrical insulation | Fire risk under high thermal stress
Transmission Lines | Long-distance power delivery | High-voltage AC transmission | Weather and load dependent
SCADA Systems | Grid monitoring and remote control | Digital telemetry, control algorithms | Vulnerable to cyber intrusion
Load Shedding Systems | Demand reduction during peak load | Automated demand-response controls | Activated during grid stress states

=====================================================
2) RISK ANALYSIS
=====================================================

Domain | Risk | FailureClass | Likelihood | Severity | RPN | Mechanism | Consequence | Mitigation
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Technical / Engineering | Transformer overload | SPF | 0.45 | 5 | 2.25 | Thermal saturation during demand surge | Localized blackouts, transformer damage | Parallel transformer banks, thermal protection
Technical / Engineering | Substation thermal fire | CMF | 0.30 | 5 | 1.50 | Insulation breakdown under heat load | Equipment destruction, service interruption | Fire suppression systems, thermal sensors
Cyber / Control | SCADA cyber intrusion | CF | 0.40 | 4 | 1.60 | Malware or network penetration | Loss of grid monitoring and control | Network segmentation, intrusion detection
Operational | Load shedding misfire | LF | 0.35 | 3 | 1.05 | Algorithm instability under rapid load shifts | Unnecessary outages, system oscillation | Adaptive demand models, human override
Environmental | Storm-induced line failure | CF | 0.55 | 4 | 2.20 | Wind, ice, lightning strike | Cascading regional outages | Underground routing, weather hardening
