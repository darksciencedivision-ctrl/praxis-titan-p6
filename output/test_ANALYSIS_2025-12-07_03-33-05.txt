**Function**: Real-time distributed sensing network composed of SCADA telemetry, Industrial IoT sensor arrays, Satellite remote sensing, LIDAR, radar, seismic, and meteorological feeds.
**Physical/Tech Principles**: Inputs stream from power stations and substations, pipelines, compressors, and refineries, dams, levees, pumping stations, rail signaling and switching systems, traffic control nodes, tectonic and atmospheric monitoring networks. Data latency target: < 200 ms at national scale.

**Component**: Digital Twin Layer
**Function**: Fully synchronized physics- based national infrastructure simulation running continuously.
**Physical/Tech Principles**: Thermodynamic power plant modeling, Hydraulic flow and pressure propagation, Electromagnetic grid stability, Structural fatigue and material aging, Transportation congestion modeling, Weather-driven load perturbation. Primary uses: Predictive load forecasting, Failure propagation analysis, Disaster scenario simulation, Condition-based maintenance scheduling, Infrastructure stress horizon mapping.

**Component**: Optimization & Control Layer
**Function**: Hybrid multi-objective decision engine that solves continuously for grid frequency and phase stability, Peak load shaving, Rotational equipment wear minimization, Fuel and energy routing efficiency, Catastrophic failure probability reduction.
**Physical/Tech Principles**: Reinforcement learning (policy optimization under stochastic loads), Model-predictive control (short-horizon deterministic stabilization), Bayesian inference (probabilistic failure forecasting), Graph-theoretic flow optimization for logistics.

**Component**: Human Oversight & Boundary Layer
**Function**: Humans define hard safety envelopes, Legal operational limits, Priority weighting (civilian vs. industrial vs. military), Emergency override permissions.
