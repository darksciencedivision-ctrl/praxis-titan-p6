1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

Component  | Function  | Physical / Technical Principles  | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Transformer Units  | Step-up voltage from lower to higher levels for long-distance transmission. | Based on magnetic induction principles. |
Substations  | Distribute power from the grid to local distribution networks. | Include protection systems and equipment grounding. |
SCADA Systems  | Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition - Monitor and control the grid's physical assets remotely. | Use communication protocols over dedicated channels. |
Load Shedding Equipment  | Automatically disconnect non-essential loads during peak demand events to maintain system stability. | Based on circuit breakers or other interrupting devices. |

2) RISK ANALYSIS

Domain  | Risk  | Mechanism  | Consequence  | Possible Mitigation
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Technical / Engineering  | Transformer overload  | Excessive current due to increased demand or equipment failure. | System-wide blackouts, equipment damage. | Install additional transformers, upgrade transformer capacity, improve maintenance practices. |
Social / Governance  | Substation fires  | Malicious or accidental incidents causing physical damage to critical infrastructure. | Loss of power for large areas, potential loss of life. | Improve security at substations, install fire suppression systems, enhance emergency response capabilities. |
Operational / Process  | SCADA communication loss  | Cybersecurity attacks, equipment failure, or natural disasters disrupting control systems. | Inability to monitor and control the grid, potential for cascading outages. | Implement cybersecurity best practices, maintain redundant communication channels, establish backup control systems. |
Technical / Engineering  | Emergency load shedding  | Inefficient or ineffective response to peak demand events. | Unnecessary blackouts, economic losses due to reduced productivity. | Develop more accurate demand forecasting models, optimize load-shedding algorithms. |
