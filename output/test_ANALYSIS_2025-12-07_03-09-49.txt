1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

Component | Function  | Physical / Technical Principles | Notes
---|---|---|---
National-scale AI system | Supervisory control over critical infrastructure | Real-time distributed sensing network, physics-based national infrastructure simulation, hybrid multi-objective decision engine | Not a governance entity; only functions in physical and operational objectives.
Volcanic Geothermal Power System (Deep Magmatic Heat Extraction) | Energy extraction from magma-adjacent rock strata without direct magma exposure | Deep Lateral Capture Shafts, Primary Thermal Exchange Vaults, Multi-Stage Turbine Trains, Secondary Energy Utilization, Hydro-Pressure Stabilization Reservoirs | Theoretical output scale of 10-50 GW continuous electric output and hundreds of petajoules per year thermal.
Centralized Coordination Model (Control Topology, Not Political Ideology) | Single Unified National Infrastructure Authority with mandatory real-time industrial telemetry and compulsory load shedding under emergency thresholds | Decentralized veto power introduces grid fragmentation, delayed catastrophe response, market-driven instability, conflicting dispatch priorities; centralized command enables faster correction, reduced cascade failures, unified disaster logistics. | This is defined as a centralized control topology, not a political value system.
System-Level Closed-Loop Operation | Physical infrastructure generates data, AI predicts failures and optimizes flows, central authority enforces execution, physical state updates | Forms a fully coupled cyber-physical governance loop.
Engineering Constraints (Reality Limits) | Practical drilling depths: 10–15 km; long-term material survivability at >800°C; supercritical fluid corrosion; seismic perturbation from thermal extraction; gigaton-scale thermal failure containment; national-scale cyber offense exposure | These constraints are based on existing technology and research, not speculative.
Civilizational Optimization & Extinction-Risk Control Theory | Primary research question: Does transferring global optimization authority from biologically driven human governance to a non-biological optimizer increase the expected survival horizon of intelligent life? | Framed as probabilistic, systems-theoretic, non-moral, non-ideological.
