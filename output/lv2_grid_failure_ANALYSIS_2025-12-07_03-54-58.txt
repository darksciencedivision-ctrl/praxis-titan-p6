3. Can redundant communication channels be further optimized to prevent SCADA communication loss during high-demand periods?
4. Are current load-shedding protocols adequate for maintaining grid stability during emergency situations, or do we need more advanced algorithms?
5. How can we improve models of transformer and substation performance under extreme load conditions?
6. What factors contribute most significantly to the likelihood of a widespread power outage due to communication loss or inadequate load shedding?
7. Can we develop better fault prediction methods for transformers and other critical grid components?
8. Is it possible to create more advanced emergency response protocols that can mitigate the impact of power outages during winter peak demand events?
