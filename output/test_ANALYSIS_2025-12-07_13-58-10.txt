1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

| Component | Function | Physical / Technical Principles | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Network transport layer | Data transfer between systems | Electromagnetic interference, signal propagation | Latency, bandwidth limitations |
| Database replication system | Synchronization of data across nodes | Atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties | Transaction integrity, data loss risks |
| Failover controller | Automatic switch to backup system in case of failure | Fault tolerance, error detection, redundancy | System uptime, resilience against component failures |
| Transaction metadata store | Storage of transaction details | Data encryption, access control mechanisms | Security, privacy risks |
| Cloud routing fabric | Traffic management within the cloud network | Load balancing, distributed systems theory | Scalability, performance optimization |

3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. What is the probability of a single packet loss causing a failover in the network transport layer during high-traffic periods?
2. How does the likelihood of an undetected database replication failure correlate with system load and synchronization rate?
3. What is the statistical relationship between cyberattacks targeting the failover controller and the successful evasion of detection mechanisms?
4. In what scenarios can weak encryption in the transaction metadata store lead to data corruption or exposure?
5. How do environmental factors impact cloud routing fabric performance, and how does redundancy mitigate these risks?
