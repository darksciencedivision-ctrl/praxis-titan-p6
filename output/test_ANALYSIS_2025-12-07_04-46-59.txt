To analyze the electrical grid under extreme winter demand, I will consider the following factors:

1. FailureClass: Short-circuits (SC), opens circuits (OC), contactor failures (CF), motor failures (MF), or lightning strikes (LS).
2. Likelihood: I will assign a value between 0.0 and 1.0 to represent the probability of each failure class occurring.
3. Severity: I will assign a value between 1 and 5, with 1 being minimal impact and 5 being severe consequences.

Based on these factors, I can compute the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each failure class by multiplying its likelihood and severity.

Here is the RPN table:

FailureClass | Likelihood | Severity | RPN
-------------|------------|----------|-----
SC            | 0.95        |   4      | 38
OC            | 0.85        |   3      | 25.5
CF            | 0.75        |   2      | 15
MF            | 0.60        |   1      | 7.2
LS            | 0.05        |   4      | 2

Note: These values are for illustrative purposes only and should not be taken as definitive predictions of risk.
