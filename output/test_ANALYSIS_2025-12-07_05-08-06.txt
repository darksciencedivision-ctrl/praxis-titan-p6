3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS (NUMBERED)
1) What measures can be taken to prevent grid overload during extreme winter demand?
2) How do power outages and blackouts impact the electrical grid's overall performance?
3) Are there any potential environmental concerns related to the electrical grid's operation during periods of high demand?
