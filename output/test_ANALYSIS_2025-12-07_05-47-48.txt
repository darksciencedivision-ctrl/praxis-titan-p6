1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

| Component | Function | Physical / Technical Principles | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transformers | Voltage conversion | Electromagnetic induction | Thermal overload risk |
| SCADA Systems | Remote grid monitoring | Digital telemetry | Vulnerable to intrusion |

2) RISK ANALYSIS

Domain  | Risk   | FailureClass | Likelihood | Severity | RPN | Mechanism     | Consequence | Mitigation
---   | ---    | ---          | ---        | ---      | ---         | ---          | ---
Infrastructure  | Load failure, Cyber failure, Single-Point Failure | SPF, CMF, CF, LF | 0.9       | 4        | 3.6        | Equipment overload risk, Remote system compromise threat   | Improved load shedding protocols, Regular software updates |
Grid dynamics | Overloaded transformers, Cascading failures | SPF     | 0.85      | 5        | 2.25     | Transformer thermal saturation risk, System-wide instability risk | Grid resilience optimization, Better transformer design |

3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. What is the maximum load a transformer can handle without risking overload or failure?
2. How do transformers' performance and lifespan change under different levels of harmonic distortion?
3. What are the critical factors determining the vulnerability of SCADA systems to intrusion attacks?
