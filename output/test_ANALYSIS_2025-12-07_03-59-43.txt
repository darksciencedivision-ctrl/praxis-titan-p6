3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. How can the AI system's predictive load forecasting models be improved to account for extreme weather events and other unforeseen circumstances?
2. Can the AI system's fault prediction capabilities be enhanced to detect potential failures earlier and prevent cascading failures from occurring?
3. What strategies can be employed to improve the overall stability of the national infrastructure
