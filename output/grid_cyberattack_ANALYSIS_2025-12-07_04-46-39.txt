To analyze the situation, I'll apply PRA XIS principles:

1. FailureClass: Considering the potential for a large-scale blackout, we can classify failures as Severe (5) - Critical infrastructure failure.
2. Likelihood: The coordinated nature of the attacks suggests that the likelihood is higher than normal, but without specific data, it's difficult to estimate.
3. Severity: As mentioned earlier, I'll consider this scenario as a Severe (5) risk due to its potential for widespread impact and cascading effects.
4. RPN Calculation: Since we don't have concrete data on the likelihood, let's assume a hypothetical value of 0.8 (highly likely). The RPN would be 0.8 × 5 = 4.0.

Based on this analysis, I recommend implementing stronger cybersecurity measures, investing in more resilient infrastructure, and improving AI-based control systems to mitigate risks associated with these coordinated attacks.
