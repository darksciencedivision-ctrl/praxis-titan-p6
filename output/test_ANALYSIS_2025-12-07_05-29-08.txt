1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

Component | Function | Physical / Technical Principles | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Transformers | Voltage conversion | Electromagnetic induction | Thermal overload risk
SCADA Systems | Remote grid monitoring | Digital telemetry | Vulnerable to intrusion


2) RISK ANALYSIS

Domain | Risk | FailureClass | Likelihood | Severity | RPN | Mechanism | Consequence | Mitigation
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Power Infrastructure (Transformers, SCADA Systems) | Transformer thermal overload risk; intermittent SCADA packet loss | SPF, CMF, CF, LF | 0.95 | 3 | 2.85 | Overheating of transformer core materials under peak harmonic distortion; digital telemetry intrusion impacting real-time grid monitoring | Loss of voltage regulation and control; compromised situational awareness for operators | Increase cooling capacity on transformers; implement SCADA system intrusion detection measures


3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. What are the critical thermal saturation thresholds for transformer core materials under peak harmonic distortion?
2. How can load failure risk be minimized in transformer stations during winter demand peaks?
