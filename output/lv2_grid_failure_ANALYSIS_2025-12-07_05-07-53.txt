1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN (TABLE)

| Component                 | Status      |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Transformer overloads     | Occurring   |
| Substation fires         | Occurring   |
| SCADA communication loss | Occurring   |
| Emergency load shedding  | Planned     |

2) RISK ANALYSIS (NUMERIC WITH RPN)

- Likelihood of transformer overloads: 0.9
- Severity of transformer overloads: 4
- RPN for transformer overloads: 3.6

- Likelihood of substation fires: 0.75
- Severity of substation fires: 5
- RPN for substation fires: 3.75

- Likelihood of SCADA communication loss: 0.85
- Severity of SCADA communication loss: 3
- RPN for SCADA communication loss: 2.55

- Likelihood of emergency load shedding: 0.6
- Severity of emergency load shedding: 2
- RPN for emergency load shedding: 1.2

3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS (NUMBERED)

1. What are the primary causes of transformer overloads in a national power grid?
2. How can substation fires be prevented or mitigated during peak demand events?
3. What measures can be taken to improve SCADA communication resilience during crises?
4. Are there strategies for more efficient emergency load shedding that minimize disruption?
