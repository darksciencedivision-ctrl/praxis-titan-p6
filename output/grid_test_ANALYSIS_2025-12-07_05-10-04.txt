| Load Management         | Optimize energy demand across the grid using real-time data and AI algorithms                                                  |
| Transformer Protection  | Monitor and protect transformers from overload or failure by adjusting load distribution                                       |
| Emergency Load Shedding  | Automatically shed non-essential loads during peak demand to maintain system stability                                          |

2) RISK ANALYSIS  (NUMERIC WITH RPN)
- Likelihood of transformer overloading: 0.5
- Severity if overload occurs: 4
- Risk Probability Number (RPN): 2

3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS  (NUMBERED)
1. How can AI algorithms optimize load management to minimize the risk of transformer overloading?
2. What emergency load shedding strategies are effective in maintaining system stability during peak demand scenarios?
