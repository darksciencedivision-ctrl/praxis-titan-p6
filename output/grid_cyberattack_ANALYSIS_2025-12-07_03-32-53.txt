1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

Component  | Function  | Physical / Technical Principles  | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Substations | Convert AC power to DC for long-distance transmission | Transformer-based conversion, isolation of high-voltage equipment | [SPECULATIVE]
Control Centers | Monitor and control grid operations | Real-time data processing, decision-making algorithms | [SPECULATIVE]
Transmission Lines | Transmit electricity across long distances | Conductor materials, line configurations, corona discharge effects | [SPECULATIVE]
Cybersecurity Systems | Protect against cyber-physical attacks | Encryption, intrusion detection, access controls, AI-based threat identification | [SPECULATIVE]

2) RISK ANALYSIS

Domain  | Risk  | Mechanism  | Consequence  | Possible Mitigation
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Technical / Engineering  | Substation equipment failure or cyber attack | Loss of power conversion, potential equipment damage | Localized blackout, possible equipment replacement cost | Regular maintenance, improved cybersecurity measures
Social / Governance  | Inadequate regulatory oversight or emergency response planning | Delayed or inadequate response to an attack, potential public safety risks | Widespread blackouts, potential loss of life | Strengthen regulatory frameworks, improve emergency response planning
Operational / Process  | Control center system failure or cyber attack | Loss of real-time monitoring and control capabilities | Cascading blackouts, potential for widespread power outages | Regular maintenance, improved cybersecurity measures, redundant control systems
