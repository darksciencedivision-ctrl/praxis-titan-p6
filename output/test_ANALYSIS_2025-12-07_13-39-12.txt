1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

| Component | Function | Physical / Technical Principles | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Network transport layer | Establish and maintain network connections for data transfer | TCP/IP protocol suite, OSI model | Bandwidth constraints, latency effects |
| Database replication system | Synchronize multiple database instances across the distributed system | ACID compliance, consistency models | Data integrity risks, conflict resolution strategies |
| Failover controller | Automatically switch to standby systems in case of primary system failure | Fault tolerance, redundancy engineering | Unintended failover scenarios, single-point failures |
| Transaction metadata store | Store and manage transaction data for auditing purposes | Data encryption, access controls | Metadata tampering risks, unauthorized access vulnerabilities |
| Cloud routing fabric | Route traffic within the cloud computing environment | Load balancing, virtualization, SDN/NFV | Routing misdirections, service degradation under load |

2) RISK ANALYSIS

| Domain | Risk | FailureClass | Likelihood | Severity | RPN | Mechanism | Consequence | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud Infrastructure Migration | Possible metadata packet loss | LF (Load Failure) | 2 x 10^-7 | 5 | 0.01 | Unconfirmed Tier-1 data loss | Regulatory re-audit, mandatory corrective actions triggered |

3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. What is the probability of unacknowledged packet loss during failover from primary to standby systems?
2. How does deterministic failover compare to stochastic failover in terms of system safety?
3. At what point does a database replication system become vulnerable to data integrity risks and conflict resolution strategies? 
4. How does regulatory exposure amplify risk compared to physical failure probability in the context of cloud infrastructure migration?
5. What are the guarantees for metadata integrity during cloud migration, given possible packet loss and latency spikes?
