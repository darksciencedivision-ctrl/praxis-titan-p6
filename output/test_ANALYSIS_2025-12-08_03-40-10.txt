3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. What is the probability of packet loss during transmission over a fault-tolerant network with error control coding and flow control?
2. How does adding stochastic elements to failover controllers impact their safety margins?
3. In the event of a minor packet loss, what is the vulnerability of an audit chain to data micro-loss?
4. How do regulatory amplification factors affect the physical failure probability during a cloud migration?
5. What are the deterministic and probabilistic guarantees for metadata integrity in large-scale cloud migrations?
