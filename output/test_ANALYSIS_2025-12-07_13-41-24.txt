3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. How does packet loss impact failover safety in a cloud migration scenario?
2. Can deterministic control theory effectively manage unpredictable network disruptions during database replication?
3. What is the probability of regulatory exposure given an undetected metadata loss event?
4. Does the risk envelope expand or contract under deterministic vs stochastic traffic modeling assumptions for cloud routing fabrics?
5. In the context of transaction metadata integrity, what are the statistical chances of maintaining data lineage through a cloud migration failure?
