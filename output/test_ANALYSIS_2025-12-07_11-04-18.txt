1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN:
**Component | Function | Physical / Technical Principles | Notes**
"Transformers | Voltage conversion | Electromagnetic induction | Thermal overload risk"
"SCADA Systems | Remote grid monitoring | Digital telemetry | Vulnerable to intrusion"

2) RISK ANALYSIS:
**Domain | Risk | FailureClass | Likelihood | Severity | RPN | Mechanism | Consequence | Mitigation**
"Power Infrastructure | Transformer failure due to thermal overload | SPF | 0.7 | 4 | 2.8 | Overheating degrades insulation, leading to short-circuit or fire risk | Replacement after x hours of operation, preventive maintenance"

3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
1. How can the efficiency of SCADA systems be improved while maintaining cybersecurity? 
2. What are the risks and benefits of integrating AI control systems into grid infrastructure?
