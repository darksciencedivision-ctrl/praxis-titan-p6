3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. What is the likelihood of a catastrophic failure event in the cloud routing fabric under high network loads?
2. How can deterministic failover safety be improved for automatic switching controllers to prevent financial exposure?
3. In the event of a single-point failure in the transaction metadata store, how does this impact regulatory compliance and reputational risk?
4. What is the expected loss magnitude for a common-mode failure in the database replication system during peak traffic hours?
5. How can packet-level loss under failover race conditions be mitigated to ensure consistent data transmission?
