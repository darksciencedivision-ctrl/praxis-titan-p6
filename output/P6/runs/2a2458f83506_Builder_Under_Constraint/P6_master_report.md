## Baseline Top Event
- p_top (analytic): 'N/A'
- Reliability: 'N/A'

## Twin Engine (Adversarial)
- Number of twins: 18
  - optimistic_01 [optimistic]: p_top=0.0, Δp_top=0.0
  - optimistic_02 [optimistic]: p_top=0.0, Δp_top=0.0
  - optimistic_03 [optimistic]: p_top=0.0, Δp_top=0.0

## Sensitivity (Top Δp_top)
- R_HW_LIMIT (Computational – Insufficient workstation capability): max |Δp_top| ≈ 0.0
- R_CERT_GAP (Training – Lack of required professional certifications): max |Δp_top| ≈ 0.0
- R_SOC_COMM (Communication – Critical system information not reaching key engineer (father)): max |Δp_top| ≈ 0.0
- R_ENG_OUTPUT (Performance – Human subsystem producing output exceeding observer expectations): max |Δp_top| ≈ 0.0
- R_SUPPORT_FAIL (Operational – Lack of external support causing throughput degradation): max |Δp_top| ≈ 0.0
