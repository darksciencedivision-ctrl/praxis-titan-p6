1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

Component | Function | Key Dependencies & Physics | Notes
---|---|---|---
**500/765 kV Backbone** | Continental bulk transfer | 112 °F → 125 °F heat dome (Texas to New York), 200+ GW cooling load |
**Transformer Fleet** | 1,200+ large power transformers (≥100 MVA) | Oil-paper insulation, top-oil + hotspot temp, Arrhenius aging |
**Natural Gas Pipeline Grid** | 85% of all generation fuel | 11 major compressor stations, line-pack physics |
**Six LNG terminals**
**Nuclear Fleet** | 54 operating reactors (58 GW) | Station blackout diesel generators (all same OEM, known common-cause) |
**Geomagnetic Disturbance (GIC)** | Solar coronal mass ejection (Carrington-class) | Quasi-DC currents in transformers → harmonic heating + relay mis-op |
**State-Sponsored Cyber** | Coordinated zero-day across all three major EMS vendors + pipeline PLCs | False telemetry, destructive wiper, remote breaker control |
**Cloud + Satellite Control Plane** | Starlink + AWS/GCP us-east-1 & us-west-2 simultaneous degradation | 85% of SCADA/EMS/AGC traffic routed via satellite + public cloud |
**Human & Organizational** | Nationwide 65% workforce loss (pandemic wave + civil unrest) | No field crews, control rooms at 25% staffing |

2) RISK ANALYSIS

Domain | Risk | FailureClass | Likelihood | Severity | Mechanism | Consequence | Current Mitigation |
---|---|--------------|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------------|
**Environmental** | **125 °F (52 °C) heat dome 5 days** | ENV | 0.85 | 5 | Extreme planetary-wave blocking | Transformers at 160–180 °C hotspot | None effective |
**Environmental** | **Carrington- level GMD (G5)** | ENV | 0.75 | 5 | 5,000 nT/min dB/dt | Massive harmonic heating + relay trips | GIC blockers on <15% fleet |
**Fuel** | **Total loss of gas compression + 5/6 LNG terminals iced-off** | CMF | 0.80 | 5 | Winter storm + cyber hits on compressor PLCs | 85% generation loss within 18 hours | Dual-fuel only 12% of the fleet |
**Cyber** | **Coordinated zero-day on all three major EMS + pipeline SCADA** | CF | 0.70 | 5 | Supply-chain backdoor activated | False telemetry + malicious breaker opens | Air-gaps bypassed |
**Cyber** | **Starlink + public cloud simultaneous multi-region loss** | CF | 0.65 | 5 | Kinetic + cyber kill of ground stations | 85% of control traffic gone | No on-prem fallback non-existent |
**Technical** | **>400 large transformers permanent damage** | CMF | 0.80 | 5 | Combined GIC + 125 °F + 150-200% overload | 24-36 month replacement delay | Spare ratio 1:120 |
**Nuclear** | **Station blackout >8 hours at ≥12 plants** | CMF | 0.60 | 5 | Grid collapse + common-mode EDG failure (known OEM defect) | Potential core damage | Regulatory waiver in place |
**Human** | **Control room + field crew <25% available** | LF | 0.90 | 4 | Pandemic + civil unrest | No restoration capability for 10+ days | None |
**Market** | **Nationwide insurance + FEMA collapse (force majeure invoked)** | LF | 0.85 | 4 | Compound loss ratio >200:1 | No capital for rebuild | Standard policies |

3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS

- What is the 95% credible interval for continental blackout lasting >14 days?
- What is the expected number of permanently destroyed large power transformers and remaining life lost (in equivalent full-load years) at 52 °C + GIC?
- After observing all nine initiating events, do any posterior distributions hit >0.999?
- Which single mitigation, if magically added today, yields the largest reduction in TE_ CONTINENTAL_COLLAPSE probability?
- How much does changing EDG common-cause β-factor from 0.05 → 0.30 move the nuclear core-damage top event?
