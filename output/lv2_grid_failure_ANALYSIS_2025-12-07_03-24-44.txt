1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

| Component | Function | Physical / Technical Principles | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transformers | Step-up voltage for long-distance transmission | Magnetic induction | Overloaded due to increased demand, risking damage or failure |
| Substations | Distribute power to local networks | Electrical insulation and circuit protection | At risk of fire during a peak demand event, compromising safety and equipment |
| SCADA Systems | Monitor and control grid operations remotely | Communication protocols and data transmission | Communication loss disrupts real-time monitoring and response capabilities |
| Load Shedding Mechanisms | Manage excess demand by reducing power supply | Demand-response algorithms | Emergency load shedding necessary to prevent system collapse during peak events |

2) RISK ANALYSIS

| Domain | Risk | Mechanism | Consequence | Possible Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Technical / Engineering | Transformer overload | Increased voltage and current due to high demand | Potential equipment damage or failure, risking blackouts | Improve transformer design for higher loads, add redundant transformers in critical locations |
| Social / Governance | Substation fires during peak events | Inadequate safety measures or insufficient maintenance | Public safety compromised, potential property damage | Implement stricter fire safety standards and regular maintenance checks on substations |
| Operational / Process | SCADA communication loss | Cybersecurity threats or infrastructure failure | Real-time monitoring and control disrupted, slower response to issues | Enhance cybersecurity defenses, implement backup communication systems |
| Technical / Engineering | Emergency load shedding | Inefficient demand-response algorithms | Unnecessary power outages during peak events | Develop more precise demand-response models for smoother load management |
