Component  | Function  | Physical / Technical Principles  | Notes

- Transformer overload: Overcurrent protection is designed to trip the transformer when it exceeds its capacity.
- Substation fires: Proper maintenance and fire suppression systems can help prevent fires, but they are not foolproof.
- SCADA communication loss: Redundant communication channels and robust protocols can improve communication reliability.
- Emergency load shedding: Load-shedding plans should be regularly updated and tested to ensure that critical loads are prioritized.
