1) SYSTEM BREAKDOWN  (TABLE)
| Component              | Description                                                                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Load Management        | Optimize energy distribution across the grid                                       |
| Transformer Protection | Monitor and protect transformers from overloads or failures                      |
| Emergency Load Shedding | Disconnect non-critical loads during peak demand to maintain grid stability       |

2) RISK ANALYSIS  (NUMERIC WITH RPN)
- Risk of transformer overload: Likelihood = 0.6, Severity = 4, RPN = 2.4
- Risk of transformer failure: Likelihood = 0.3, Severity = 5, RPN = 1.5
- Risk of non-critical load disruption: Likelihood = 0.1, Severity = 2, RPN = 0.2

3) RESEARCH QUESTIONS  (NUMBERED)
1. How can AI optimize the distribution of energy during peak demand to minimize risk?
2. What algorithms can be used to monitor and protect transformers from overloads or failures efficiently?
3. How does emergency load shedding impact non-critical loads, and how can this impact be minimized?
